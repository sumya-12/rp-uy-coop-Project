Example:
"It's important for analysts to have expert attention to detail and an ability to identify larger trends from highly specific data sets. As an analyst, I strive to remember the larger objectives when I complete my work. That way, I can notice patterns that might be significant to the company. Attention to detail is something I pride myself on as well. Minor mistakes can add up over time and effect the success of projects. I can be a bit of a perfectionist, but the result is usually cleaner processes and reports."
